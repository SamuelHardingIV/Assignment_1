# Kickstarter_Challenge
## Purpose of the Kickstarter_Challenge ##
  Lousie started a crowdfunding campaign but she came close to the fundraising goal. Now, she wants to know how diferent campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that you’ve already combed through, you’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. You’ll then submit a written report based on your analysis and the visualizations you create. 

## Analysis and Challenges ##
  I performed my analysis based on the dataset provided with high emphasis on Country, Successful Goals, Failed Goals, Canceled Goals and Categories to get a high-level view of the dataset. Challenges encountered formatted the date from timestamp, breakdown outcomes based on goals chart data and saving this work. I was able to overcome my challenges by googling and YouTube videos.  
  
 ### Outcome Based on Launch Date ###
  In this chart, we see that May and June months are more successful in the “Theater” category. Louise should target these two months which would give her ~70% success rate. See Chart below:

### Outcome Based on Goal ###
  In the chart, goals range from $20,000 below and $30k to $50k has a higher success percentage. Louis should look for a mentor in the $30k to %50k bracket and pick their brains. Your analytic team can have does names to you by the COB. See Chart below:
